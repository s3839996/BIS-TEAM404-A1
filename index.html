         <li><b>Personal Background: </b>I am 19 years old and I am Australian.</li>
         <li><b>IT Passion: </b>My IT passion has stemmed from my fascination with gaming, as since I was young it has been one of my favourite past times. 
            I soon started to get fascinated with the technology behind them, which had me intrigued in programming. I never got much of a chance to learn programming
         in high school, so my journey to RMIT has been a great opportunity to further my IT knowledge across the board. 
         I am looking forward to learning more about the IT world and feel this project will benefit greatly to that goal.</li>
         <li><b>Strengths / Interests: </b>I feel I can be good at problem solving certain IT troubles, as I have had some
            experience with fixing computer issues for both myself and family members. I am mostly interested in expanding 
            my knowledge though, learning more about the IT world and hoping to become a programmer in the near future.</li>
         <li><b>Weaknesses / Areas to improve: </b>I feel in context of the project, my lack of IT experience compared 
            to other group members may be noticeable, however I hope to use this weakness as an opportunity to learn and
            to gain a better understanding of the IT industry.</li>
         <li><b>Project Challenges: </b>This project will help to challenge me with not only furthering my IT knowledge, but also breaking out of my comfort zone
         and working well with my team members. I am a shy person, so I hope to help out the group and communicate as much as I can to assist 
         making the final submission to be as high quality as possible. As said before, I hope to also learn from the other more IT experienced team members, such as
         programming tips, more advanced HTML coding and just general knowledge of the IT world.</li>

         <h1 id="projectDescription">Project Description</h1>
         <p>Finding parking within CBD's in Australia can be challenging, especially during peak hours. The development
            of 'Quick Park' application will assist users to conveniently park their vehicles amidst all the hustle
            bustle within the city. Users are required to install the application, register their vehicle, enter their
            card details, location and get started. The app will highlight all the available parking and indicate the
            distance from the user to the car park. Users can check the most convenient parking and can select and book
            the desired parking lot. Once booked, the parking will be reserved for a given duration and the user will
            have a guaranteed car parking lot available for the selected time period. The user will receive turn by turn
            instruction on how to get to the carpark. They are also given the option to pre-book a day ahead meaning
            that the car parking service is allocated for a given time period, but the user must enter and exit the
            parking lot within strict timings to avoid penalties. Using the app, users can utilise cash less payment
            system and manage parking fees and extend/shorten carpark time, thereby only paying for the exact amount of
            time they used the service. </p>
         <h4>User Stories</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>"As a manager, I want to save my time so that I don't arrive late to work". </li>
         <li>"As a novice driver, I want to have a secured route with parking so I can avoid getting stressed". </li>
         <li>"As a mum of three, I want to find a convenient parking location, so I can drop my children off to
            kindergarten safely and effortlessly". </li>
         <li> Having reserved parking means that you don't have to worry about being late to work or an important
            occasion trying to find parking. Just within a few clicks on your mobile device you can enjoy simple and
            effortless parking options, whilst receiving updates on the vehicle condition and location. The live
            navigation system will ensure that you'll never have to go looking for where you parked your car every
            again. Quick Park application aims to reduce stress for car drivers, finding an affordable and convenient
            parking within busy business districts in Australia. </li>

            </ul>
         <br>

         <h1 id="features">Features</h1>
         <h2>Minimum Viable Features</h2>
         <h4>Registration and Profile Editing</h4>
         <p>Registration will consist of fetching basic information such as name, address, and contact details. Also, information about the car will be collected. The main feature of the profile page will consist of allowing the user to see statistical information such as the time, usage and money spent throughout various car parks. Details include an hour by hour breakdown of cost, which may could also include each individual car if there are multiple cars on file with a particular profile.</p>
         <br>
         <b>Validation: </b><br>
         <ul>
            <li>Using brute force in text input fields which require a certain format. E.G. birthdates dd/mm/yyyy. In an ideal senecio the tester will enter an invalid birthday format or an unreasonable birthday such us 09/8/2283 (which is a future date) and the app should alert the user. </li>
            <li>Manually input data to one's profile to see if calculation methods and formulas are correct for the 'statistical information' section.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Quick bookings</h4>
         <p>Quick bookings feature will allow the user to enjoy a quick 2 click booking for parking. This will consist of the most frequent bookings on the home page. Once a user selects their preferences, all they need to do is click pay to automatically complete transaction using a credit card or other payment method that is already on file. The second part of the quick booking scenario includes the ability to use the phones native voice control system to book a parking spot. Allow the user to mention to the voice control system the place of booking and the duration. Time of start does not need to be mentioned since the time limit will begin once the user enters.</p>
         <br>
         <b>Validation: </b><br>
         <ul>
            <li>A group of beta testers/developers can be used with a pre-defined testing table which highlights each scenario, plus the expected output from the application. Testing can try each scenario in the app and note down the actual results and any differences from the expected and actual results. For example, one scenario should be where the users try to book a car spot in a parking centre that is closed. The expected result is that the app would notify the user that the centre is closed and is currently unavailable for booking. But if the actual result was that the app let the user book a parking spot in a closed car park then this result should be noted down in the testing table which the developers can use to rectify the certain issue.</li>
            
         </ul>
         <h4>Live tracking / Built in GPS</h4>
         <p>Once a user enters a car park, a built-in map will open inside the app and with the user's permission, the app will use the current location of the user to help them navigate throughout the car park and assist them in finding the pre booked car park. Once a user arrives at the correct car park, the app will automaticity start the count-down to when the e-ticket will expire. And as usual the GPS can help find the nearest parking location based on the user's current location. Also, the app features an interactive map with the locations of the parking spots which are supported, which can be clicked on to easily make a booking.</p>
         <br>
         <b>Validation: </b><br>
         <ul>
            <li>This feature is best tested in a real-life scenario where a developer or tester goes to the specific spot to see if the GPS location/map location matches with the current location in which the actual user is at. It is crucial that this feature works correctly due to it avoiding confusion and parking in the wrong spot. Thus, this can reduce the need for the user to contact customer support. This testing can also be done with beta testers who can be rewarded with free parking for testing the app.</li>
            
         </ul>
         <h4>Payment</h4>
         <p>The payment section will consist of a quick and easy solution to calculate ticket fares. The app will utilise the internet time and location to determine what the time is for the user's current location, which is then used to determine the fare for the user (whether its peak time or not). If the user is calculating a fare for a future booking, they can enter the location and time manually to get the corresponding fees/prices.</p>
         <p>The app will consist of several cashless payment solutions. This includes an online terminal credit card processor, PayPal and device specific services such as (Google pay, Apple Pay, Samsung pay). In some cases, paying cash at the payment window/terminal will be available depending on the location. At the end of transaction, the user will be reminded that they can save their payment details for any future transactions. This would come with the ability to print a receipt at the end of a certain transaction, which can then be saved to the users native file system or sent as an email.</p>
         <br>
         <b>Validation: </b><br>
         <ul>
            <li>Use the Sandbox feature that is provided by many payment service providers. This Sandbox scenario will simulate a real-life scenario. For example, using PayPal’s sandbox mode when a transaction is initiated, PayPal then creates a mock transaction which behaves exactly like a transaction in a real word environment. This can be used to diagnose payment issues without the use of real payment details or deploying a beta version of an app to the public where users could lose money or jeopardise their payment details.</li>
            
         </ul>
         <h4>Contact Us / Feedback</h4>
         <p>The best solution is to implement an existing Helpdesk provider (e.g. ZenDesk). The benefits of this include that it already provides the customer with different forms of contact via the app that have already been tested and perfected. Such examples include built in voice chat or text chat, and these services often already have a good help ticket managing system already in place. This would benefit the business as it will be easy to track and respond to complaints and questions, which would lead to satisfied customers. The contact/support page would have a form to submit anonymous feedback and an option to connect support in a non-urgent scenario. Which would often use the user’s devices native mail app to send an email to support staff.</p>
         <br>
         <b>Validation: </b><br>
         <ul>
            <li>Using test email to see if an email is sent on the client sides and also the check if the email is received on the support staff's side.</li>
            <li>Since feedback is anonymous, the testing phase must make sure all feedback that is sent and all identifying information is removed in the phase where the feedback is sent from the customers device to the support staff.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h2>Extended Viable Features</h2>
         <h4>Integration for businesses</h4>
         <p>A new feature that could be built into the app is business integration. This would allow business managers to create
            spending accounts for their employees. Users would be able to separate their transactions, and businesses would be
            able to immediately view their employee's receipts. For example, if an employee needed to drive to the city for a 
            business meeting, they could put it under the business account. This would charge the businesses credit card instead 
            of the employees personal account and the business manager would be able to view that transaction to make sure that 
            it was approved. 
            <br><br>

            <b>Validation: </b><br>
         Some methods of validating this feature would be to: <br>
         <ul>
            <li>Allow businesses to test the beta version to ensure that businesses can efficiently use the app. This could be done
            by finding businesses that normally pay for their employees transport/parking fees which are also willing to use the 
               app to manage their employee's funds/transactions through the app. </li>
            <li>Check that the using the business features on the app make businesses more efficient compared to users having 
               to manually send their company a receipt and then have that company send the funds back to their employee. 
               This could be checked by asking businesses and employees if they think the process is simpler. </li>
         </ul>
         
         
         </p>
         <h4>Integrating into mapping service apps</h4>
         <p>Integrating the Quick Park system into a mapping service app such as Google Maps or Apple Maps would make users trips
            more efficient as they would have the ability to link their Quick Park accounts to a mapping service app. By linking 
            their accounts users would have the option to automatically book an available parking spot nearest to their 
            destination all within the same app. Users would not need to use their phone while driving to try and find a 
            parking spot instead they could make the booking as they entered their destination into the app or they could book
            it during their journey by talking to Googles smart assistant or Apples Siri which are both integrated into their 
            respective apps. 
            <br>
            By allowing users to speak to their smart assistant while driving we are not only making it simpler for people to 
            find a parking location but also creating a safer environment where people have one less reason to go on their phones
            while driving. 
      <br><br>
            <b>Validation: </b><br>
         Some methods for validating this feature could be surveys: <br>

         <li>Asking users of the app if they believe being able to book a parking nearest to their destination would be useful. </li>
      <li>Asking users if being able to ask their smart assistant to book a car spot would be a useful feature to have. </li>
      <li>Asking users how often they look at their phones while driving to find somewhere to park (with or without the Quick Park app). </li>
      <li>Once implemented asking users how often they use the built in feature to book a car spot. </li>
</ul>

      </p>
         <h4>Price Comparison</h4>
         <p>Parking in the city can become very costly even for just a few hours. Quick Park could help solve this issue through 
            a price comparison feature. This feature would show various parking locations in a specified area in order to allow 
            its user to find the best parking spot for them. A user might be willing to spend more money to park closer to where 
            they want to go, or maybe the user wants to save a few dollars and instead walk. That is what this feature would 
            allow its users to choose.  
   <br><br>
            <b>Validation: </b><br>
            Some methods of validating this feature would be to:    <br>
   <ul><li>Determine if users are saving money by using this feature </li>
    <li>Asking users if they are choosing parking spots further away to save money through online surveys either in app or email users links. </li>
   <li>Test to see how the new price comparison feature integrates with the rest of the app. </li>
</ul>
   </p>

         <h1 id="projectMotivation">Project Motivation</h1>
         <p>Our group chose this idea because we stumbled upon a similar project, known as the 'Android Parking Booking Project.' 
            We saw that this project's main goal was to be able to create an application in which users can find and reserve parking spaces ahead of time,
            so that they can easily access one when they arrive at their destined location. We felt this idea was very useful and quite advanced,
            as such we thought it'd be great to not only expand on this idea but popularise it as it could be very helpful with day-to-day tasks,
            as well as give us a challenge to improve our IT abilities. We also understand the frustration that comes with finding a parking space,
            so this project would be a great investment to get rid of what can be a common issue during shopping periods. A couple of us drive cars,
            as such we'd be able to have ideas and suggestions from drivers in the team that will improve the experience of the application,
            as well as help with making it better for our target audience, being of course those who drive often. Starting work on this application now,
            despite the pandemic of COVID-19 being a current worldwide issue, would be getting ahead of any competition. Having an application like this 
            ready for once the world is more free to go outside would be a great opportunity, and give us a ton of users as many would want to go out and
            may struggle to find a parking spot once people are able to roam free. We also stress that our goal is not to copy the original project, but
            rather expand upon the idea and include our own personal features that we feel would benefit it. </p>

         </table>
         <p>The above tables outline the tasks that are needed to complete Part A of Assignment 1 as well as the
            workload spread, who's completing which task and the date that it is due and the group members and their
            strengths and weaknesses. Each group member previously completed the Introduction to Information Technology
            course and is aware of the requirements of this project and the commitment required in order for the project
            to be successful. The table is similar to a Trello Board but has been condensed for presentation purposes.
            Due to the amount of time it took to decide on a group project, there wasn't a lot of time to complete the
            tasks for Assignment 1 Part A.
            <br><br>
            As per the group contract, each group member knows that delegated tasks should be completed within the
            allocated timeframe. If assistance is required, each member is expected to raise concerns and support each
            other. The group contract also expresses that resources, such as Canvas, Microsoft Teams, Trello and GitHub,
            need to be used properly and meetings or status updates must occur at least twice a week.
            Group members are also aware in the event that they are not meeting set expectations, a group meeting should
            be held to address these issues, and if the problem persists, it will be reported to the tutor, lecturer, as
            well as being reflected on SparkPlus. Part of this requires open communication and honesty within a group
            Before dividing the tasks, the strengths and weaknesses of each group members was declared and from there
            the tasks were divided best on the strengths and weaknesses so that each assigned task could be played into
            those strengths.
            <br><br>
            Some of the tasks were assigned to be completed as a group such as the designing of the website, managing
            the Trello Board and contributing to the group contract whereas other tasks were divided up equally amongst
            the group members. By doing this, the workload was fairly balanced and there wasn't too much pressure placed
            on a single group member.
            <br><br>
            Given that most group members expressed a strength in Java, this was chosen as the primary programming
            language for our project. The same can be said for HTML, as we all expressed strength with HTML we will all
            be contributing to authoring and designing the website on GitHub, which will then be moved to AWS. The
            individual tasks were estimated by the group to be completed in similar timeframes and with a similar time
            dedication to them, thus each group member was assigned minimum two tasks each.
            It was also determined that one user would be responsible for setting up the Git Repository and AWS Site,
            whilst all users are comfortable with using these services, it was more convenient to have one group member
            set it up and the others would contribute as to avoid errors with permissions.

         <br>

         <h1 id="risks">Risks</h1>
         <h2>Risks that significantly interfere with project outcomes</h2>
         <p><b>Risk: </b>Integration Risk - Project fails to integrate technologies</p>
         <p><b>Example: </b>Our proposed application will be integrating several technologies in order to satisfy some
            of the minimum viable features. An example of one is payment, our application needs to integrate a payment
            system that is widely used and trusted. However, implementing such a system may prove to be a risk of being
            over budget due to the complexity being underestimated. Another example is the integration of GPS services,
            and this may present another risk through the many troubles of integrating this into the application, whilst
            also ensuring that the system is accurate and performs up to specifications.</p>
         <p><b>Mitigation: </b>The risk of these integrated technologies being a failure can be mitigated by conducting
            further research into the systems that are available and selecting one that is easy to implement and is
            being widely used and supported in the industry.</p>
         <br>

         <p><b>Risk: </b>Market Risk - Project has significant competition, resulting in a lower demand.</p>
         <p><b>Example: </b>Our proposed application has already been implemented by several other competitors, such as
            "Secure a Spot", "PayStay" and "EasyPark" (just to name a few). This existing high presence of similar
            applications may cause potential conflict or lead to a decrease in users (or being difficult to get a large
            user base in the first place) due to there already being existing products on the market. Due to this risk,
            those who manage these parking spots to the public (whether it be public or private businesses) may conclude
            that it's not worth making their spots available to yet another application that is the same as the existing
            ones (as it may not be worth the cost in paying us to have their spots on the app, and they aren't
            guaranteed a return on investment). Not only this, but another example of a potential market risk is that
            not many businesses use these parking booking applications, and instead choose to use their own proprietary
            systems (ticket machines, etc). This would mean a lower demand for our application.</p>
         <p><b>Mitigation: </b>Through proper advertising and smart marketing strategies, our application can be
            promoted and made aware to both the consumers and those who manage the parking spots, outlining the many
            benefits of using our application in comparison to traditional systems such as those ticket machines.</p>
         <br>

         <p><b>Risk: </b>Legal Risk - Project includes the collection of personal information, resulting in potential
            breaches.</p>
         <p><b>Example: </b>Our proposed application requires that a user "sign's up", hence, requiring them to enter
            their personal information, such as name, email address and phone number. Not only this, but a user must
            enter details about their vehicle, such as make, model, and registration (which are used to verify the
            vehicle that has booked and parked in the spot). Additionally, the user can store payment information, and
            this can be potentially problematic due to possible breaches / cyber-attacks.</p>
         <p><b>Mitigation: </b>To ensure that all users understand and acknowledge the collection and storage of their
            personal information, it would be critically important to include a privacy policy that can be accessed by
            the user, especially when they are initially signing up. Using enterprise grade encryption when storing all
            personal information would be a way to mitigate the risk of a data breach, as well as requiring users to
            assign a password to their account to act as an additional layer of security.</p>
         <br>

         <h2>Team dynamics related challenges</h2>
         <p><b>Challenge: </b>Weak leadership</p>
         <p><b>Mitigation: </b>Speak to the team leader directly. Give feedback on their performance and invite them to
            reflect on their time as leader, and how their leadership could possibly be changed / improved to better
            support the team's goals.</p>
         <br>

         <p><b>Challenge: </b>Low engagement</p>
         <p><b>Mitigation: </b>Focus on building an engaging team environment. Encourage stronger relationships between
            team members, and the sharing of ideas. </p>
         <br>

         <p><b>Challenge: </b>Lack of communication</p>
         <p><b>Mitigation: </b>Implement tools to promote communication and encourage the team members to communicate to
            each other on a regular basis. Ensure that there are frequent updates about any project changes and make it
            clear to members that they should feel comfortable with communicating with other members, or even with the
            team leader if necessary. </p>
