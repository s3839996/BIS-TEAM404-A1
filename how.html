    <h4>Microsoft Teams</h4>
    <p>Microsoft Teams will be the primary source of communication between the group members as well as between group members and their course mentor and lecturer who will be keeping progress of the team. Teams meetings will occur at least once a week and web cams will be switched on. Meetings will also be recorded for future reference. </p>
    <br>
    
     <h4>Canvas</h4>
    <p>Canvas will be the place where assignment updates and specifications are uploaded and released as the project progresses. A private group has also been created for the group which they have been assigned to and this can be used for group discussions and communication. </p>
    <br>
    
     <h4>Trello</h4>
    <p>Trello is a collaboration tool that will be used to keep track of the project as it progresses. Trello acts like a virtual whiteboard with sticky notes attached that outline tasks that need to be completed as well as their intended completion date. When finished, the task can be marked off. </p>
    <br>
    
     <h4>GitHub</h4>
    <p>GitHub is another collaborative tool that provides hosting for software development. It will be used to share HTML files for the group website and Java files for programming the project. The repository is setup by one user and the other group members are responsible for committing to the branches and providing evidence of their work on GitHub. </p>
    <br>
    
     <h4>Java Editor</h4>
    <p>A java editor, such as Eclipse, is used by the group to code the project. Any editor will work including Eclipse, Visual Studio Code or even GitHub itself and a file is saved with the “jar” extension. </p>
