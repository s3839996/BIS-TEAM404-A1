		    as between group members and their course mentor and lecturer who  will be keeping progress 
		    of the team. Teams meetings will occur at least once a week and web cams will be switched on. 
		    Meetings will also be recorded for future reference. </p>

	    <h4>Canvas</h4>
            <p>Canvas will be the place where assignment updates and specifications are uploaded and released as the project progresses. A private group has also been created for the group which they have been assigned to and this can be used for group discussions and communication. </p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>Trello</h4>
            <p>Trello is a collaboration tool that will be used to keep track of the project as it progresses. Trello acts like a virtual whiteboard with sticky notes attached that outline tasks that need to be completed as well as their intended completion date. When finished, the task can be marked off. </p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>GitHub</h4>
            <p>GitHub is another collaborative tool that provides hosting for software development. It will be used to share HTML files for the group website and Java files for programming the project. The repository is setup by one user and the other group members are responsible for committing to the branches and providing evidence of their work on GitHub.</p>

            <p>Note: Link to GitHub Repository can be found below.</p>	 
            <h4>Java Editor</h4>
            <p>A java editor, such as Eclipse, is used by the group to code the project. Any editor will work including Eclipse, Visual Studio Code or even GitHub itself and a file is saved with the "jar" extension.</p>
            <br>
		 
            <h1 id="collaborativeWorkspace">Collaborative Workspaces</h1>
            <h4>Microsoft Teams</h4>
            <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/conversations/IS-TU-830-TEAM404?threadId=19:3a05c5ec5f2f4484a9bdef20852ce5f6@thread.tacv2&ctx=channel">Microsoft Teams Channel</a>
            <p>Microsoft Teams will be our groups primary collaborative space, where we will conduct all necessary
		    meetings and communication. It will be the main place to share any work or files, making it easy
		    for all members to access. All members are aware how to access this workspace, which can be accessed
		    through the URL above, or alternatively can be accessed as a sub-channel on the COSC2625 Microsoft Teams Group.</p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>Canvas</h4>
            <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/groups/233514">https://rmit.instructure.com/groups/233514</a>
            <p>Canvas will play the role of being used to handle assignment submissions. It's particularly useful as it allows for only 
		    one member to have to submit an assignment, with it then being accessible to all other members. All members are aware
		    how to access Canvas, as well as how to make a submission.  </p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>Trello</h4>
            <a href="https://trello.com/b/R5f7Sktt">https://trello.com/b/R5f7Sktt</a>
            <p>Trello will be the workspace in which all tasks can be identified, listed, and formally organised.
		    This will make it significantly easier for all members to identify what tasks have been / still need to be completed,
		    as well as giving them the ability to outline what tasks they have completed. Although Trello is something that none of us have used previously,
		    we have been able to quickly adapt to it, and we all feel comfortable in accessing it and using it for this project. </p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>GitHub</h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/s3839996/BIS-TEAM404-A1.git">https://github.com/s3839996/BIS-TEAM404-A1.git</a>
            <p>GitHub will be particularly useful when developing any code-related work, such as the website, or the application itself. 
		    GitHub will allow for members to collaboratively work on aspects of these types of work, such as each member developing
		    a separate section of the website or application. A member can then “commit” their work to GitHub, which can then be accessed
		    by other members, as well as serving as a backup in the event of a disaster. All members have used GitHub previously,
		    and are aware how to make commits to the repository.  </p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>Word Online</h4>
            <p>Word online will be used to collaborate on the final report for the assignment, as well as being used to share and contribute to any other
		    ideas or material. All members are aware how to access Word, as the links have been provided through Microsoft Teams for their convenience.  </p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>AWS</h4>
	    <a href="https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/is-tu-830-team404-a1/?region=us-east-1&tab=overview">https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/is-tu-830-team404-a1/?region=us-east-1&tab=overview</a>
            <p>AWS will be used to host the website, which can then be accessed and previewed by any members or teachers. 
		    All members have used AWS previously to host their websites for Intro to Information Technology, so as
		    such all feel comfortable in setting up a bucket and hosting a website or any other files.</p>
            <br>
		 
            <h4>SyncFiddle</h4>
            <a href="https://syncfiddle.net/">https://syncfiddle.net/</a>
            <p>SyncFiddle was used for HTML/CSS code collaboration. This was particularly useful when Josh and Michael were designing the website, as it allowed for them to both work on the code at the same time and also have the ability to see a live preview of that code in action.</p>
